abstract="Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods, also known as likelihood-free techniques, have appeared in the past ten years as the most satisfactory approach to intractable likelihood problems, first in genetics then in a broader spectrum of applications. However, these methods suffer to some degree from calibration difficulties that make them rather volatile in their implementation and thus render them suspicious to the users of more traditional Monte Carlo methods. In this survey, we study the various improvements and extensions brought on the original ABC algorithm in recent years.",

	abstract = {The paper is concerned with methods for the estimation of the coalescence time (time since the most recent common ancestor) of a sample of intraspecies DNA sequences. The methods take advantage of prior knowledge of population demography, in addition to the molecular data. While some theoretical results are presented, a central focus is on computational methods. These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population. The methods are illustrated using recent data from the human Y chromosome.},

abstract = {The importance of environmental stochasticity for tropical tree dynamics has been recently stressed by several studies. This has spurred the development of a ‘time-averaged neutral model’ of community dynamics by Kalyuzhny and colleagues that extends the neutral model by incorporating environmental stochasticity. We here show that this framework can be used to assess the presence of non-random correlations between species dynamics. Indeed, the time-averaged neutral model makes the simplifying assumption that species responses to environmental variation are uncorrelated. We therefore propose to use this model as a null hypothesis against which observed community dynamics can be compared. This study makes five contributions. First, we describe a novel time-averaged neutral model of community dynamics that is close to, but more flexible than the one previously proposed by Kalyuzhny and colleagues. Second, we develop an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and demonstrate the identifiability of the model parameters from community time series data. Third, we develop a test of the significance of environmental stochasticity, and a method to quantify its contribution to population variance. Fourth, we develop a test of non-random correlation between species dynamics. Fifth, we apply these developments to three datasets of tropical tree dynamics. We evidence both a strong contribution of environmental stochasticity to population variance in the three datasets, and a non-random correlation of species dynamics in one of them. We finally discuss the implications of these results for the modelling of tropical tree community dynamics.},
