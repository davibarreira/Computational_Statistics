\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=!,labelindent=5pt]
\item First, let $X' = X^{(t)}$, $X = X^{(t-1)}$, $Y' = Y^{(t)}$ and
$Y = Y^{(t-1)}$
. Then:
$$
K^S((x,y),(x',y')) = \pi_{Y\mid X}(y' \mid x) \pi_{X \mid Y}(x' \mid y')
$$

Then, to show that it is not reversible:
$$
\pi(x,y)K((x,y),(x',y')) = \pi(x,y) \pi(y' \mid x) \pi(x' \mid y')
$$
$$ 
\pi(x',y')K((x',y'),(x,y)) = \pi(x',y') \pi(y \mid x') \pi(x \mid y)
$$
$$
\therefore
$$
$$
\frac{\pi(x,y)K((x,y),(x',y'))}
{\pi(x',y')K((x',y'),(x,y))} =
\frac{\pi(x,y) \pi(y' \mid x) \pi(x' \mid y')}
{\pi(x',y') \pi(y \mid x') \pi(x \mid y)} = 
\frac{\pi(y)\pi(y' \mid x)}
{\pi(y')\pi(y \mid x')} \neq 1
$$
Therefore, it is not reversible.
\qed

\item First, the kernel expression:
$$
K(x, x') = \int \pi(y' \mid x) \pi(x' \mid y') dy'
$$

Now, let's show that it is $\pi_X$-reversible.
$$
\pi(x')K(x', x) = \pi(x') \int \pi(y \mid x') \pi(x \mid y) dy
=
\int \pi(x') \frac{\pi(y,x')}{\pi(x')}\pi(x\mid y) dy =
$$
$$
=
\int \pi(y,x') \pi(x \mid y) dy = 
\int \pi(y,x') \frac{\pi(x,y)}{\pi(y)}dy =
\int \pi(x,y) \frac{\pi(x',y)}{\pi(y)}dy =
$$
$$
= \pi(x)\int \pi(y \mid x) \pi(x' \mid y)  dy = \pi(x)K(x,x')
$$
\qed

\item First, the kernel expression is:
$$
K^R((x,y),(x',y')) = 
\pi(y' \mid x)\pi(x' \mid y')0.5 + \pi(x' \mid y)\pi(y' \mid x')0.5
$$
Note that it is half the density of sampling first from $y$ plus 
half the density of sampling first from $x$.

Now, let's show that it is reversible:
$$
\frac{\pi(x,y)[\pi(y' \mid x)\pi(x' \mid y')0.5 +
\pi(x' \mid y)\pi(y' \mid x')0.5]}
{
\pi(x',y')[\pi(y \mid x')\pi(x \mid y')0.5 +
\pi(x \mid y')\pi(y \mid x)0.5 ]
} = 
$$
$$ =
\frac{
	\frac{\pi(y' \mid x)}
	{\pi(y')}
	+
	\frac{\pi(x' \mid y)}
	{\pi(x')}
}
{
	\frac{\pi(y \mid x')}
	{\pi(y)}
	+
	\frac{\pi(x \mid y')}
	{\pi(x)}
} = 
1
$$
\qed
